# Homework 6: Clustering

In this assignment, the Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm is explored for clustering.
The goal is to be familiar with the process of clustering in general on distributed environments and 
various distance measurements. The datasets used here is a synthetic dataset generated to meet
the assumptions of the BFR algorithm.

## Task

## Dataset
Since the BFR algorithm has a strong assumption that the clusters are normally distributed with
independent dimensions, a synthetic dataset is generated by initializing some random centroids and
creating some data points with the centroids and some standard deviations to form the clusters. Outliers are also added 
in the dataset to evaluate the algorithm. Data points which are outliers belong to clusters that are named or indexed as
“-1”. A sample of the dataset is given below.
The first column is the data point index. The second column is the name/index of the cluster that the data point belongs
to. The rest columns represent the features/dimensions of the data point.
