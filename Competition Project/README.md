# Competition Project (Recommendation System)

The performance of the recommendation system from [homework 3 task 2](../homework-assignment-3) is 
improved to get better accuracy and efficiency. Exact details are available in the [project specifications](Competition%20Project%20Description.pdf). 


## Task

Here various features are used form the ```user.json```, ```business.json```, ```checkin.json```, ```tip.json```, ```photo.json``` and ```review_train.json``` files in addition to the training
dataset to train a model based on a regressor based on Decision Tree using the [```XGBRegressor```](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html)
library. For the final submission, even the validation dataset is used to train the model for the test set which remains hidden.

#### Warning: Spaghetti üçù Code in this Assignment!

## Dataset

The training and validation datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17JIpck9KcXA2aZYfNGsOFgGTM0qlmPkZ?usp=sharing). The test dataset is hidden and is, thus, inaccessible.
Note: This dataset is the same as homework 3 dataset. Additional files are used to improve the performance of the recommendation system from 
by acute feature engineering on the available datasets.

### File 1: ```yelp_train.csv```
This is the subset of the original dataset that is used for training only. <br/>
The file contains records of reviews by users on businesses in the form of stars. A small sample of the dataset is given below.

In two years since we started to living together, I'm now a de-facto vegetarian, and yes, I eat local organic food whenever possible. \n\nDoes it come cheap? No, more like N.O. I don't really like looking at my grocery receipt. But I guess it's within reasons, and I do like supporting local farmers and manufactures. \n\nI can't end the post without giving shout-out to those people who come up with the Deli item recipes.
