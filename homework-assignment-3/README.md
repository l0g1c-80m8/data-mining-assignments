# Homework 3: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems

There are two tasks in this homework. The goal is to get familiar with Locality Sensitive
Hashing (LSH), and different types of collaborative-filtering recommendation systems. The dataset
required for this assignment is a subset from the Yelp dataset used in the previous assignments.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Jaccard Based LSH

### Task 2: Recommendation System


## Dataset

The training and validation datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17JIpck9KcXA2aZYfNGsOFgGTM0qlmPkZ?usp=sharing). The test dataset is hidden and is, thus, inaccessible.
